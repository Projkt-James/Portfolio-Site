var about_contents = `
My name is James Hanford, I'm a 25 year old Fullstack Developer living in Brisbane, Australia. 
I currently work as a member of a team bringing video content creation to the world through an in-browser editor called ClipChamp.
From an early age I have had a passion for everything technical, since discovering computer programming towards the end of primary school, I've been hooked. I'm also an avid space enthusiast, mainly well read on the happenings of the current commerical resuable rockets space race.
I find great pride within the code and tangible experiences I build for people, there is nothing more satisfying than watching an end user enjoy something that I have built.`;
